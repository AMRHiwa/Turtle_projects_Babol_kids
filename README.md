Hi everyone.

My name is Mohammad Rasul Azizi, a Python professor and programmer and a senior expert in artificial intelligence.

In this repository, I have put beautiful examples of my students' projects in the bootcamps of Babol city of Mazandaran province in Iran, in which they have been implemented in the field of painting using turtle in Python.
